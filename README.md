# Moody-s-Analytics-Climate-API-Integration
This repository provides a Python-based solution to interact with Moody's Analytics Climate API (EDF-X and ESG). The program retrieves Probability of Default (PD) and other climate-adjusted metrics based on input data from an Excel file, and saves the results to an output directory.
